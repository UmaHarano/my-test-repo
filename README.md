ArcGIS Pro SDK for Microsoft .NET is the new .NET SDK for the ArcGIS Pro Application. This SDK leverages the .NET features and programming patterns to create Add-Ins that can be used to extend ArcGIS Pro. The ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET is provided as an extensibility mechanism for ArcGIS Pro. Extensibility to ArcGIS Pro is provided by the Framework extension - specifically _ArcGIS.Desktop.Framework.dll_. ArcGIS Pro can be extended by _"Plug-ins"_ to the Framework extension using Add-ins. These plug-ins to the Framework can be implemented through _"Contract"_. ArcGIS Pro extensibility is provided through its API. No separate Primary Interop Assemblies (PIAs) are needed.

The ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET extensibilty uses the concept of Add-ins first introduced with ArcGIS 10.0. The add-in model provides a _declarative framework_ for creating a collection of customizations conveniently packaged within a single compressed file, called _"the" Add-in_. Add-ins are easily shared between users as they do not require installation programs nor Component Object Model (COM) registration; add-ins are added to a system by simply copying them to a well-known folder and removed by deleting them from this folder. Add-ins can also be shared between users within an organization using a centralized network share.
